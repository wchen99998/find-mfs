    """
    Configuration for matching against a single isotope envelope measurement.

    This approach compares the predicted isotope pattern against a single
    observed envelope using RMSE scoring between aligned intensity
    vectors.

    This class can be passed to FormulaFinder or FormulaSearchResults to
    initiate isotope pattern matching

    Attributes:
        envelope: 2D numpy array of [m/z, intensity] pairs representing
            the observed isotope envelope. Intensities will be normalized
            such that the base peak is 1.0

        mz_tolerance_da: Maximum m/z difference (in Da) for a predicted peak
            to match an observed peak. Either this or mz_tolerance_ppm must
            be specified.
            Default: None

        mz_tolerance_ppm: Maximum m/z difference in ppm for a predicted peak
            to match an observed peak. Either this or mz_tolerance must be
            specified.
            Default: None

        simulated_mz_tolerance: Resolution for simulating theoretical
            envelopes. Peaks closer than this will be combined.
            Default: 0.05

        simulated_intensity_threshold: Minimum relative intensity threshold
            for including peaks in the simulated envelope.
            Default: 0.001

        minimum_rmse: Minimum intensity RMSE to be considered as a
            candidate with a sufficiently matching isotope envelope

            This should be based on the instrument's fidelity
            at reproducing isotope patterns

            Default: 0.05

    Example:
        >>> observed = np.array(
        ...     [[180.063, 1.0],
        ...      [181.067, 0.11]]
        ... )
        >>> config = SingleEnvelopeMatch(
        ...     envelope=observed,
        ...     # mz_tolerance_da=0.01,  # Tolerance in Da or ppm
        ...     mz_tolerance_ppm=4.0,
        ... )
